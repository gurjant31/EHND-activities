# EHND-activities
Class Activities for Ethical Hacking and Network Defense 01 (for CSFM 1)

# Description 

This repo contains the class activities for the 'Ethical Hacking and Network Defense 01'. Total 6 Class activities and final project are the main focus of this repo. Focus of these activites are to teach each step of penetration testing. 

## Getting Started

These instructions provide you details to complete each activity and required report documents. Follow each step documented in this repo. Google can be a good resource. You are free to use any tools you see fit for your requirement.


```
It is adviced to google each activity. Objective of first 6 activities to get the idea of penetration testing methods. Try to learn the steps and not focus on results at this time. Apply all learned methods to the final test to finding vulnerbailities and build your report.
```
### Selecting Target for activities
* Go to hackerone.com
* Select any listing website as target
* Apply all the activity methods to that target

```
Note: You won't be able to find any thing on those targets don't gets your hopes high. Main focus is to learn the steps.
```


### First Activity - Passive Information Gathering:
Passive information gathering require you to gather information about the target without intracting with it. Make a report out of it which include your results,scan steps and submit it.

```

### Second Activity - Active Information Gathering:
Active information gathering means to scan your target directly with the help of security scanning tools or any manual testing. Read through the references and try to use each tool in kali to gather as much information as possible. Make a simple report of your findings and submit it.

```

### Third Activity - Network Scanning:
Network scanning is similar to active information gathering.Use information gathered from the last 2 activities to perform this activity. Network scanning focuses on scanning the network of your target, getting the idea about the structure of your target and finding about the services running on your target. This will help you in finding vulnerabilities in next activity. Build a report and submit it.

```

### Fourth Activity - Vulnerability Scanning:
Information gathered from the last activites should be used to search for the vulnerabilities. You can use automated tools or look for the vulnerabilities depending upon the services running on your target for public known vulnerabilities. List those vulnerabilities in word document file and submit it.

### Fifth Activity - Exploiting the Vulnerability:
This activity requires you to exploit the vulnerabilities you found in the last activity. Try to google about the exploitation methods depending upon your findings. Don't be upset if you didn't get any successful exploitation. List your steps you did for vulnerability exploitation, submit it and be happy :)

```

### Sixth Activity - Post Exploitation:
Post Exploitaion is only possible if you are successful in your exploitation attempt.Post Exploitation means to get a reverse shell on the system and hide your shell. It will be graet if you will be successful in your post exploitation.

```
You don't need reference, I know ;)
```

### Final Assignment (Group):

It's a requirement for you to create group of 3 to 4 people. You will be assigned a target for your final presentation. You have to do the penetration testing on your target and create a final penetration tesitng report. Try to apply everything that you have learned in all the activities. Final targets are listing in the target.txt file in this repo. 
* Select a target from the target list
* Conduct the penetration testing
* Build the final report of your testing
* Present the report and your finding the class
