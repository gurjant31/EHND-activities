# EHND-activities
Class Activities for Ethical Hacking and Network Defense 01 (for CSFM 1)

# Description 

This repo contains the class activities for the 'Ethical Hacking and Network Defense 01'. Total 6 Class activities and final project are the main focus of this repo. Focus of these activites are to teach each step of penetration testing. 

## Getting Started

These instructions provide you details to complete each activity and required report documents. Flow each step documented in this repo. Google can be a good resource.


```
It is adviced to google each activity. Objective of first 6 activities to get the idea of penetration testing methods. Try to learn the steps and not focus on results at this time. Apply all learned methods to the final test to finding vulnerbailities and build your report.
```
### Selecting Target for activities
*Go to hackerone.com
*Select any listing website as target
*Apply all the activity methods to that target

```
Note: You won't be able to find any thing on those targets don't gets your hopes high. Main focus is to learn the steps.
```


### First Activity - Passive Information Gathering:
Passive information gathering require you to gather information about the target without intracting with it. Make a report out of it and submit it.

======
1st Exercise(Todays Exercise):
Passive Information gathering: Which will include using kali and google to passively collect information about the target. This will provide deeper understanding into first phase of penetration testing.
2nd Exercise:
Active Information gathering: It includes interacting with the target to get information about target. This includes from Port Scanning to working with error messages.
3nd Exercise:
Network Scanning: Scan internal network of target to produce the internal map of the network. DNS exploitation can be possible here.
4rd Exercise:
Looking form Vulnerabilities: After gathering information about the target, the next step is to find the vulnerabilities in the target. This is will again use the Kali tools.No programming experience required. 
5th Exercise:
Exploiting the Vulnerability: This exercise will include exploitation of the simple vulnerabilities. 
6th Exercise:
Post Exploitation: In this exercise it require to get file from hacked machine.

From 6th Exercise the Flow of Exercise changes:
7th Exercise:
Cryptography Challenge: The information gathered from the 5th exercise provide the cryptography challenge file. Which requires use of google to crack the hash.
8th,9th Exercise:
CTF: 8th and 9th exercise will be the Capture the flag challenge. This is useful to implement all the information learned from last exercises.
10th Exercise:
Final challenge: Exercise required using the all information to scan target and produced the Penetration Testing report. Challenge will be completed in groups.

2 Assignments (Group Assignment):
Groups will prepare Penetration Testing report from 10th Exercise. This will be 20% and then group has to present their findings as a presentation which again will be 20%.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
